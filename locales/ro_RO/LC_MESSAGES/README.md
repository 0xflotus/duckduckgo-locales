# Romanian Language Guidelines

## Diacritics

There are five diacritics in the Romanian alphabet: Ă, ă, Â, â, Î, î, Ș, ș, Ț, ț. Note the Ș, ș, Ț, ț have a comma bellow, not a cedilla. The use of cedilla variants Ş, ş, Ţ and ţ, while not uncommon, is incorrect.

## Style

It is recommended to use an informal style where appropriate. Polite personal pronouns or verbs in second person plural form should be kept to a minimum.

Jocular expressions should be avoided unless explicitly called for. E.g.:

    msgid "We get a ton of searches, and all of them are anonymous."
    msgstr "Avem o tonă de căutări, și toate sunt anonime."
The translation maintains the intended tone.

## Neologisms, loanwords, technical terms

It's recommended to use the Romanian equivalent where possible. However the translator should consider standard language as opposed to linguists recommendations. Examples:

**browser** - should be translated as *browser*, not *navigator [de Internet]*; the former is more common

**email** - though *email* is the standard (IETF) spelling, the term *e-mail* was introduced in various Romanian dictionaries since at least 1997; additionally, the word *email* has a distinct entry in the dictionary, meaning *enamel*

**link** - as is; translates to *legătură*, but it's seldom used

**meme** - though not standardized, should be translated as *memă*

**online** - as is

**site** - should be translated as *site*, not *sit* or *sait*


## Privacy

The English language might make a distinction between *privacy*, *confidentiality* and *intimacy*, however the word *privacy* can be translated as either *confidențialitate* (*confidentiality*) or *intimitate* (*intimacy*), depending on the context. Considering DuckDuckGo's emphasis on *privacy*, special care should be taken when translating the word. As a rule of thumb, *confidențialitate* seems more appropriate than *intimitate*.
